/** 
	Modules are an integral piece of any robust application's architecture and typically help in keeping the units of code for a project both cleanly separated and organized.
	In JavaScript, there are several options for implementing modules. These include:
		-The Module pattern
		-Object literal notation
		-AMD modules
		-CommonJS modules
		-ECMAScript Harmony modules
	The Module pattern is based in part on object literals and so it makes sense to refresh our knowledge of them first.

/** 
 Disadvantages:
	The disadvantages of the Module pattern are that as we access both public and private members differently, when we wish to change visibility, we actually have to make changes to each place the member was used.
	We also can't access private members in methods that are added to the object at a later point. That said, in many cases the Module pattern is still quite useful and when used correctly, certainly has the potential to improve the structure of our application.
	Other disadvantages include the inability to create automated unit tests for private members and additional complexity when bugs require hot fixes. It's simply not possible to patch privates. Instead, one must override all public methods which interact with the buggy privates. Developers can't easily extend privates either, so it's worth remembering privates are not as flexible as they may initially appear.
